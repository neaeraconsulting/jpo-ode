# JPO Quarterly Release Process
The quarterly release process is designed to prepare the code for a new release at the end of each quarter. This process involves several steps: creating a new release branch, stabilizing the code, updating project references, building the release, and testing it. These steps are performed sequentially for each project, starting with those that have no dependencies and progressing outward through the dependency chain.

The order of project releases is as follows:
1. Stage 1:
   1. [asn1_codec](#asn1_codec)
   2. [jpo-cvdp](#jpo-cvdp)
   3. [jpo-security-svcs](#jpo-security-svcs)
   4. [jpo-sdw-depositor](#jpo-sdw-depositor)
   5. [jpo-utils](#jpo-utils)
   6. [jpo-asn-pojos](#jpo-asn-pojos)
2. Stage 2:
   1. [jpo-ode](#jpo-ode)
   2. [j2735-ffm-java](#j2735-ffm-java)
3. Stage 3:
   1. [jpo-geojsonconverter](#jpo-geojsonconverter)
   2. [jpo-mec-deposit](#jpo-mec-deposit)
4. Stage 4:
   1. [jpo-conflictmonitor](#jpo-conflictmonitor)
   2. [jpo-deduplicator](#jpo-deduplicator)
5. Stage 5:
   1. [jpo-cvmanager](#jpo-cvmanager)
   2. [jpo-s3-deposit](#jpo-s3-deposit)

**Note:** jpo-s3-deposit is placed last in the release order because it is not a dependency for any other project releases. Its completion timing has minimal impact compared to the other projects in the release pipeline.


## asn1_codec
### Prerequisites
None

### 1. Code Ready & Release Notes
    - [ ] Release notes drafted & added to `Release_notes.md` file in `docs` directory
    - [ ] Code changes for release are merged into `develop`
    - [ ] A new branch `release/(year)-(quarter)` is created from `develop`

### 2. Preliminary Testing
    - [ ] code compiles
    - [ ] unit tests pass
    - [ ] program starts up correctly
    - [ ] program can be configured for decoding successfully
    - [ ] program can be configured for encoding successfully
    - [ ] messages get decoded as expected
    - [ ] messages get encoded as expected

#### Details on how to do tests

Run compilation and unit tests in Docker: From the root directory of asn1_codec issue:
```
docker build -t acm .
docker run --env-file .env --name acm -it acm
```
In a separate shell:
```
docker exec -it acm bash
/build/acm_tests
```

where the `.env` file is configured with necessary environment variables.

To test program startup and encoding/decoding:

Pull the release branch into the ODE submodule, and run the ODE via `docker compose up --build -d` from the jpo-ode root directory, with the following profiles set in the `.env` file:
```
COMPOSE_PROFILES=ode,adm,aem,kafka,kafka_setup,kafka_ui
```
To test decoding send test messages with the `udpsender_generic.py` script and verify the messages are decoded by looking at the `topic.Asn1DecoderOutput` in the kafka UI.

To test encoding, use the Kafka UI to produce one of the decoded messages from `topic.Asn1DecoderOutput` to `topic.Asn1EncoderInput` and check the decoded output appears on `topic.Asn1EncoderOutput`.
